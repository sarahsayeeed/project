            <h2>Game Stop Shop</h2>
            <p>GameStop Corp. is an American video game, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer. The company is headquartered in Grapevine, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and is the largest video game retailer worldwide.
                A video game[a] or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device)
                 to generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or
                 a virtual reality headset.</p>

            <h2>Immerse Yourself in Gaming</h2>
            <p>Explore the vast worlds of video games and experience unparalleled adventures. From epic quests to heart-pounding action, there's something for every gamer.
                The gameplay experience varies radically between video games, but many common elements exist. Most games will launch into a title screen and give the player
                 a chance to review options such as the number of players before starting a game. Most games are divided into levels which the player must work the avatar 
                 through, scoring points, collecting power-ups to boost the avatar's innate attributes, all while either using special attacks to defeat enemies or moves 
                 to avoid them. This information is relayed to the player through a type of on-screen user interface such as a heads-up display atop the rendering of the 
                 game itself. Taking damage will deplete their avatar's health, and if that falls to zero or if the avatar otherwise falls into an impossible-to-escape
                  location, the player will lose one of their lives. Should they lose all their lives without gaining an extra life or "1-UP", then the player will reach the "game over" screen.

            <p>Dive into the latest releases and uncover hidden gems. With stunning graphics and immersive gameplay, the possibilities are endless.
                Early arcade games, home consoles, and handheld games were dedicated hardware units with the game's logic built into the electronic
                 componentry of the hardware. Since then, most video game platforms are considered programmable, having means to read and play multiple
                  games distributed on different types of media or formats. Physical formats include ROM cartridges, magnetic storage including magnetic-tape
                   data storage and floppy discs, optical media formats including CD-ROM and DVDs, and flash memory cards. Furthermore digital distribution
                    over the Internet or other communication methods as well as cloud gaming alleviate the need for any physical media. In some cases, the 
                    media serves as the direct read-only memory for the game, or it may be the form of installation media that is used to write the main 
                    assets to the player's platform's local storage for faster loading periods and later updates.
